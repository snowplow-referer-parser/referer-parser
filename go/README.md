# referer-parser Go library

This is the Go implementation of [referer-parser][referer-parser], the library for extracting search marketing data from referer _(sic)_ URLs.

The implementation uses the shared 'database' of known referers found in [`referers.yml`][referers-yml].

The Go version of referer-parser is maintained by [Thomas Sileo][tsileo].

## Installation

```console
$ go get github.com/snowplow/referer-parser/go
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
  "log"

  "github.com/snowplow/referer-parser/go"
)

func main() {
  referer_url := "http://www.google.com/search?q=gateway+oracle+cards+denise+linn&hl=en&client=safari"
  r := refererparser.Parse(referer_url)

  log.Printf("Known:%v", r.Known)
  log.Printf("Referer:%v", r.Referer)
  log.Printf("Medium:%v", r.Medium)
  log.Printf("Search parameter:%v", r.SearchParameter)
  log.Printf("Search term:%v", r.SearchTerm)
  log.Printf("Host:%v", r.URI)
}

```

## referers.yml embed

The [`referers.json`][referers-yml] is embedded in the package using [`go-bindata`][go-bindata].

```
$ go-bindata -ignore=\\.yml -pkg refererparser data/...
```
