# referer-parser

referer-parser is a database for extracting marketing attribution data (such as search terms) from referer URLs, inspired by the [ua-parser][ua-parser] project (an equivalent library for user agent parsing).

The referer-parser project also contains multiple libraries for working with the referer-parser database in different languages.

referer-parser is a core component of [Snowplow][snowplow], the open-source web-scale analytics platform powered by Hadoop and Redshift.

_Note that we always use the original HTTP misspelling of 'referer' (and thus 'referal') in this project - never 'referrer'._

## Database

The latest database is always available on this URL:

https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/snowplow-hosted-assets/third-party/referer-parser/referers-latest.yaml

The database is updated at most once a month. Each new version of the database is also uploaded with a timestamp:

https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/snowplow-hosted-assets/third-party/referer-parser/referers-YYYY-MM.yaml

If there is an issue with the database necessitating a re-release within the month, the corresponding files will be overwritten.

## referers.yml

referer-parser identifies whether a URL is a known referer or not by checking it against the [`referers.yml`][referers-yml] file; the intention is that this YAML file is reusable as-is by every language-specific implementation of referer-parser.

The file is broken out into sections for the different mediums that we support:

* `unknown` for when we know the source, but not the medium
* `email` for webmail providers
* `social` for social media services
* `search` for search engines

Then within each section, we list each known provider (aka `source`) by name, and then which domains each provider uses. For search engines, we also list the parameters used in the search engine URL to identify the search `term`. For example:

```yaml
Google: # Name of search engine referer
  parameters:
    - 'q' # First parameter used by Google
    - 'p' # Alternative parameter used by Google
  domains:
    - google.co.uk  # One domain used by Google
    - google.com    # Another domain used by Google
    - ...
```

The number of referers and the domains they use is constantly growing - we need to keep `referers.yml` up-to-date, and hope that the community will help!
