# referer-parser Python library

This is the Python implementation of [referer-parser] [referer-parser], the library for extracting search marketing data from referer _(sic)_ URLs.

The implementation uses the shared 'database' of known referers found in [`referers.yml`] [referers-yml] (converted to a `referers.json` file,
see below).

The Python version of referer-parser is maintained by [Don Spaulding] [donspaulding].

## Installation

    $ pip install referer_parser

## Usage

Create a new instance of a Referer object by passing in the url you want to parse:

```python
from referer_parser import Referer

referer_url = 'http://www.google.com/search?q=gateway+oracle+cards+denise+linn&hl=en&client=safari'

r = Referer(referer_url)
```

The `r` variable now holds a Referer instance.  The important attributes are:

```python
print(r.known)              # True
print(r.referer)            # 'Google'
print(r.medium)             # 'search'
print(r.search_parameter)   # 'q'     
print(r.search_term)        # 'gateway oracle cards denise linn'
print(r.uri)                # ParseResult(scheme='http', netloc='www.google.com', path='/search', params='', query='q=gateway+oracle+cards+denise+linn&hl=en&client=safari', fragment='')
```

Optionally, pass in the current URL as well, to handle internal referers

```python
from referer_parser import Referer

referer_url = 'http://www.snowplowanalytics.com/about/team'
curr_url = 'http://www.snowplowanalytics.com/account/profile'

r = Referer(referer_url, curr_url)
```

The attributes would be

```python
print(r.known)              # True
print(r.referer)            # None
print(r.medium)             # 'internal'
print(r.search_parameter)   # None
print(r.search_term)        # None
print(r.uri)                # ParseResult(scheme='http', netloc='www.snowplowanalytics.com', path='/about/team', params='', query='', fragment='')
```

The `uri` attribute is an instance of ParseResult from the standard library's `urlparse` module.

## referers.json

Unlike the other ports, the Python version of referer-parser uses a `referers.json` file, generated from the main `referers.yml` file. This is for two reasons:

1. Python's standard library includes a JSON parser but not a YAML parser
2. Loading from JSON in Python is significantly faster than loading from YAML

To support the `referers.json` file, the distribution process for Python looks like this:

    $ ./sync_yaml.sh
    $ python/build_json.py
    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wininst upload
